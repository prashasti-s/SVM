PREDICT HEART ATTACK BY USING SVM

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm capable of performing classification, regression and even outlier detection. The linear SVM classifier works by drawing a straight line between two classes. All the data points that fall on one side of the line will be labeled as one class and all the points that fall on the other side will be labeled as the second. The classifier separates data points using a hyperplane with the largest amount of margin. 

**The accuracy of the model is 81.3%**

**The cross validation accuracy of the model is 81.6%**
